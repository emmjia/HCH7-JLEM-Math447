##7.1

\textbf{Consider the experiment described in Problem 6.1.
Analyze this experiment assuming that each replicate represents
a block of a single production shift.}

```{r}
# defining coded
coded=function(x) #a function to code variable x
{
  ifelse(x=="+", 1, -1)
}

# creating data table
factorA = rep(c("-","+","-","+","-","+","-","+"), times = 3)
factorB = rep(c("-","-","+","+","-","-","+","+"), times = 3)
factorC = rep(c("-","-","-","-","+","+","+","+"), times = 3)
Rep = rep(c("I", "II", "III"), each = 8)
yield = c(22,32,35,55,44,40,60,39,31,43,34,47,45,37,50,41,25,29,50,46,38,36,54,47)

#dataframe
cutting.speed.long = data.frame(factorA, factorB, factorC, Rep, yield)

cutting.lm = summary(lm(yield ~ Rep + factorA * factorB * factorC, cutting.speed.long)); cutting.lm
```

##7.2

\textbf{Consider the experiment described in Problem 6.5.
Analyze this experiment assuming that each one of the four
replicates represents a block.}

##7.13

\textbf{Using the data from the $2^4$ design in Problem 6.22,
construct and analyze a design in two blocks with ABCD confounded
with blocks.}

##7.24

\textbf{Suppose that in Problem 6.1 we had confounded ABC
in replicate I, AB in replicate II, and BC in replicate III.
Calculate the factor effect estimates. Construct the analysis of
variance table.}

##7.25

\textbf{Repeat the analysis of Problem 6.1 assuming that
ABC was confounded with blocks in each replicate.}
